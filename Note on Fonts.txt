## Note on Fonts

* Must be a monospaced Unicode (UTF-8 encoded) font (eg. Menlo, as included)
* The .ttf file must be somewhere on the hard drive, but not in /Library or (explicitly) /'Mobile Documents'
* The code will generate two .pkl files in the directory of the file's .ttf; the exact names of these files need to be put in the code (towards the end) so that they are deleted once the program has been executed

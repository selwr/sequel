## Ideas

* This will be a scaled-down version of poirot, for more formal use
* Have an overall area at the top of the output file showing:
    * total papers (P)
    * total topics (T)
    * total pages (G)
    * ratio P:T
    * ratio G:P
    * ratio G:T
* Then have a pypi tabulate Table output showing rows for each of the subjects:
    * number of papers (p)
    * number of topics (t)
    * number of pages (g)
* I stress: no graphics, no contents list, no colours - just a very basic list & table

* Will be two 'external' documents in Almanac:
    * analyse.command
    * metrics.txt

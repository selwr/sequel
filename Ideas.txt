## Ideas

* This will be a scaled-down version of poirot, for more formal use
* Have an overall area showing:
    * total papers (P)
    * total topics (T)
    * total pages (G)
    * total storage size (Z)
    * ratio P:T

* Then have a table output showing rows for each of the subjects:
    * number of papers (p)
    * number of topics (t)
    * number of pages (g)
    * memory size (z)

* I stress: no graphics, no contents list, no colours - just a very basic table

* Will be two 'external' documents in Almanac:
    * analyse.command
    * Analysis.pdf

1. Loop over folders in Almanac , and then files in there
2. Add one to the papers count for that folder, and then to the pages count for that folder, and for file size (converted)
3. Check if [ in filename
4. If there isn’t, add one to topic count, and if there is and then only if [1] in filename, add one to topic count
5. Then at the end of that subject folder, append the four values to the array
6. The total figures can be calculated with running totals

* Must make sure all ints get made into strings (could use f-strings)

* Try get the highest in each metric underlined within each column

* Make it so there’s a second table under the ‘subject’ table that is a ‘totals’ table that just has the sum of the above columns. These numbers should be in bold.

* Find a place for the ‘ratios’ somewhere. Maybe write them as text.

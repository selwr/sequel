## Ideas


* Introduce themes into the report

* There will be 6 themes:
    - Space
    - Physics
    - Chemistry
    - Biology
    - Mathematics
    - Technology

* There will be a themes table at the top of the document, giving the totals underneath

* Organise contents by themes

* The main directory would contain subfolders for the relevant themes, and then the files would be in the sub-sub-directories
